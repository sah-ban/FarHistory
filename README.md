# FarHistory

This project is a Farcaster Frame built using [frames.js](https://framesjs.org/), the [Airstack](https://airstack.xyz/) validator and node package.

FarHistory is a Farcaster Frame designed to provide key insights into a Farcaster user's account creation details. It uses the Farcaster and Airstack API to fetch and display:
- The date the account was created.
- How many days ago the account was created.
- The percentage of users who joined Farcaster after the main user.
- The FID (Farcaster Id) of the most recently created account.

This tool is inspired by similar account analysis utilities and is built for simplicity and efficiency.

## Demo
Check out the live version at [https://warpcast.com](https://warpcast.com/cashlessman.eth/0x8e9158db).

## Features
- **Account Creation Date**: Displays the precise date an account was created.
- **Days Since Creation**: Computes and shows how many days ago the account was created.
- **User Ranking**: Calculates how many percentage of users joined Farcaster after the queried account.
- **Recent Account**: Fetches and displays the FID (Farcaster Id) of the most recently created account.

## How It Works
- Just click on the "Check Me" button on the Frame.
